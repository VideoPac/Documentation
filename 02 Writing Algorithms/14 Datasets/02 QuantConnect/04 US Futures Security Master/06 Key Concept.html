<p>This dataset allows users to construct continuous futures, allowing the access of normalized historical data of the underlying assets, as well as trading the “lead” future contracts for those assets.
<br /><br />
Continuous futures refer to sets of rolling lead future contracts during their actively trading periods. Since future contracts will expire at their maturities, to retrieve the historical price movement of the underlying assets, continuous futures are needed for their time series analysis.
<br /><br />
In LEAN, a continuous future can be accessed by a canonical symbol object:</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">
self.continuous_contract = self.AddFuture(Futures.Energies.CrudeOilWTI,
                                          dataNormalizationMode = DataNormalizationMode.BackwardsRatio,
                                          dataMappingMode = DataMappingMode.OpenInterest,
                                          contractDepthOffset = 0)
self.symbol = self.continuous_contract.Symbol
</pre>
<pre class="csharp">var _continuousContract = AddFuture(Futures.Energies.CrudeOilWTI,
    dataNormalizationMode: DataNormalizationMode.BackwardsRatio,
    dataMappingMode: DataMappingMode.OpenInterest,
    contractDepthOffset: 0
);
var _symbol = _continuousContract.Symbol;</pre>
</div>
<p>Note that in order to have a seamless transition of the underlying contracts, it is necessary to have the <i>dataNormalizationMode</i> and <i>dataMappingMode</i> inputs. For technical details, please refer to the later part of this doc.
<br /><br />
However, a canonical symbol is only mapped to the security added by <i>AddFuture</i> as a reference but not any underlying future contract. It works fine to trade within the backtest, but could be subjected to friction costs during live trading, as the order price used could be a normalized price. Please refer to “Live Trading Considerations” part of this docs for details.</p>
